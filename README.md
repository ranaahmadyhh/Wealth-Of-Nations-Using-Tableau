# Wealth of Nations Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the **Wealth of Nations** dataset, focusing on the **top 20 highest-ranking countries** in three key areas:

- **Life Expectancy**
- **Smartphone Usage**
- **GDP per Capita**

The data has been cleaned, processed, and transformed using **Excel** and then imported into **Tableau** to create insightful visualizations that align with the client's requirements. Special care was taken to ensure accessibility for colorblind users, as requested by the client.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

The **Wealth of Nations** dataset contains three sheets:

- **GDP**
- **Life Expectancy**
- **Smartphones**

### Steps Taken:
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   - Ensured data integrity by filtering, formatting, and applying necessary formulas for calculations in Excel.
   
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converted data into tables for easier management and analysis.
   - Ensured correct data types were assigned to each column.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Top 20 Countries - Life Expectancy** üìä

This visualization summarizes life expectancy data for the top 20 countries. The key insight from the data is that **life expectancy** does not show a clear correlation with a country's economic standing. Life expectancy remains relatively consistent across the highest-ranking countries, indicating that factors like healthcare and quality of life may not always align directly with a country‚Äôs economic power.

### 2. **Top 20 Countries - Smartphone Users** üì±

This visual shows the number of smartphone users across the top 20 countries. It was observed that **China** has the highest number of smartphone users, while **France** has the lowest. Interestingly, there is **no direct correlation** between a country‚Äôs GDP per capita and its smartphone usage. Some countries with lower GDPs have higher numbers of smartphone users.

### 3. **Top 20 Countries - GDP Per Capita** üí∏

The final visual highlights **GDP per capita** across the top 20 countries. **Monaco** has the highest GDP per capita at **¬£190,513**, driven by luxury services and tourism. On the other hand, **Denmark** has the lowest GDP per capita at **¬£57,804**, showcasing a significant economic gap. Monaco's GDP per capita is nearly three times greater than that of Denmark.

## Insights üí°

- **Life Expectancy**: There is no obvious trend linking life expectancy to GDP per capita among the top 20 countries. However, continued focus on improving healthcare and quality of life could be beneficial for countries aiming to improve life expectancy.
  
- **Smartphone Usage**: The data shows that countries with lower GDPs often have higher smartphone penetration, which could be attributed to the increasing affordability of smartphones and their role in bridging economic gaps.

- **GDP Per Capita**: The gap in GDP per capita between Monaco and Denmark underlines how small, wealthy nations can have extremely high levels of economic output. Countries like Monaco, relying on tourism and luxury services, are outliers in the global economic landscape.

## Recommendations:
- Countries with lower GDP per capita should consider further promoting technology and smartphone adoption, as these tools can drive economic growth.
- For better life expectancy, focusing on social healthcare systems, access to clean water, and nutritious food might be more impactful than GDP alone.
